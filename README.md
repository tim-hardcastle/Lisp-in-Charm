An implementation of Lisp in the Charm programming language.

The features, though not the details of the implementation, are based on Peter Norvig's lis.py.

This can therefore serve as documentation for the Lisp implementation until I write something better. http://norvig.com/lispy.html

Instructions are given to the Lisp interpreter in the form ex \<string\>, e.g. ex "(+ 2 2)".
